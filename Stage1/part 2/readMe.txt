Fot this part I have used matrix which is shown in photo called 'matrix'
The original photo is 1-11 which shows Standard Behavior.
1-1,1-2, 1-3, 1-4 photos are the results with its original versions of the 4 Binary Layers.
On the left side you can find the original photo on which one of the Binary Layers is applyed and
on the right side you will find the the same Binary layer on which the Convolve is applyed.
