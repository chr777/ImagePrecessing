Here in 1-binary_layer_0 you will find 1-original-image(which is not showing standart behavior) with binary-layer-0 in left 
and Match plugin appled on original image and then applyed binary_layer_0 in the right.
The same as above is done in 1-binary_layer_1.
From above result we can see that binary_layer_0 applyed after Match is showing the egdes of the face as we wanted, but binary_layer_1 is 
not very effective in this particular image
But 2-original-image which is not showing standart behavior starts showing it after apllying Matching



** Matching code can be found in Code folder
